      When people say it's cold in Buffalo, they mean it. Buffalo does not know what "Fall" is. The first time I came here,
     it was HOT. The next thing I knew, it was already winter. No such thing as Fall here. Right now, it hasn't snowed hard 
     enough where you can jump into the snow and build your own grave. At most, it's only 2 inches of snow. At least you can 
     make snowballs and throw it at people. Be warned: the snow does not melt for a while, even if you go indoors. All that happens
     is that it goes into ice form. If you throw it at this stage, then be prepared to lose a friend cause that's not snow; that's a rock.
